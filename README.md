# AI-Hand-Tracking-Project
Hands often get in the way of each other as seen by a camera (think of a fist or handshake) and lack high-contrast patterns. To develop an HGR system, AI algorithms are trained to recognize labeled data and predict unknown data based on the developed model. A hand tracking database is the first step in AI training.
